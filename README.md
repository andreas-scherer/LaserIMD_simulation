This Github repository contains the program that was used for the LaserIMD simulations in the manuscript
"Site-Directed Labeling with Photoexcitable Spin Labels for Light-Induced Pulsed Dipolar Spectroscopy"
(Williams, et.al. 2020).

The folder "executables" contains the compiled program and the parameter files in corresponding subfolders
that are needed to reproduce the experiments from the paper.

The folder "source_code" contains the uncompiled C++ code as well as the grids that used for the simulations,
The grids were generated with th easyspin function "sphgrid". The corresponding Matlab script can be found in
the same folder as the grids.
